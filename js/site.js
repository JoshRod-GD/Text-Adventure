                crystal was nothing like anyone had ever seen many say it had the power of 100 armies and could
                somehow bend space and time with its power. The king  luckily used it for keeping the peace within
                the lands  hoping to never have to use its power everything was peaceful within the kingdom until the day
                the Shadow Army came crashing in and took the Kings Crystal by force. A few hours later  you are at a local pub
                enjoying your time with the people when a knight of the kings personal guards comes in and tells you all about the
                horrifying events that have just occured and once he hands you a letter from the king himself  it reads
                You are the only one that can save us all please help save the kingdom and help us get our crystal home before chaos
                can reach our kingdom!...After reading this you grab your weapons and head out on a journey to find the Shadow Army and
                return the crystal to the rightful owner.",
